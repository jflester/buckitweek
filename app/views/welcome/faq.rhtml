      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

       <p>Ok, well maybe not. We actually have no idea what questions are frequently asked. But these might be some of them, and if they aren't maybe they should be.</p>

     <h2>What is Buckit Week?</h2>
     <p>In a nutshell, Buckit Week is a time of intensive, systematic teaching of the Word of God in areas of key Bible concepts. Additionally  
       <ol>
          <li>Unfolding the book of Romans</li>
          <li>The church, especially local church truth</li>
          <li>Bible study methods: hands-on, practical exercise</li>
          <li>Bible truth communication: actual practice communicating the truth of God's Word</li>
          <li>Old Testament overview and New Testament overview</li>
       </ol>

       That's a lot of material to cover in 5 days time, so don't plan
       on eating or sleeping. Ok maybe a little, but it is going to be
       intensive.
     </p>

    <h2>Does this mean Buckit Week is just for &quot;advanced&quot; students of the Bible?</h2>
    <p>Not at all. There will be young men and women at various stages
    in their Christian growth and experience. A good attitude toward
    learning during this week is more important than an advanced background.</p>


    <h2>Will there be time to fellowship with the other believers there?</h2>
    <p>Yes! - the meals and breaks will be great times for this. Some of the
    homework will also lend itself to working together.</p>

    <h2>When is Buckit Week?</h2>
    <p><b>July 22-27, 2007.</b> This is a Sunday evening through
    Friday evening. The reason for the scheduling is to allow people
    to be part of Buckit Week and still have time to rest from (or
    rest for) another activity the previous (or next) week.</p>

    <h2>Where is Buckit Week?</h2>
    <p>Buckit Week 2007 will be held in the Springhill Suites hotel in
    Hagerstown, Maryland. This is a newly-built, beautiful hotel with
    lots of amenities convenient to the needs of this
    week. <a href="http://marriott.com/hotels/travel/hgrsh-springhill-suites-hagerstown/" title="Springhill Suites, Hagerstown, MD" target="_new">The hotel website</a> is
    a great source of information about the specific amenities
    offered, but questions about any Buckit Week arrangements should
    be made through <%= link_to 'Buckit week contacts', :controller => 'welcome', :action => 'contact' %> rather than direct contact with the hotel.</p>

    <h2>What if I am flying in for Buckit Week?</h2>
    <p> The best airports to fly into probably will be in the
    Washington, DC area. Enough people will be attending from there
    that rides can be arranged. The three Washington airports are
    Washington-Dulles (<a href="http://www.metwashairports.com/Dulles/" title="IAD" target="_new">IAD</a>), Reagan-National (<a href="http://www.metwashairports.com/national/" title="DCA" target="_new">DCA</a>), and
    Baltimore-Washington (<a href="http://www.bwiairport.com/" title="BWI Airport" target="_new">BWI</a>).  There is a very small regional airport in
    Hagerstown itself (<a href="http://www.flyhagerstown.com/" title="HGR" target="_new">HGR</a>), but we expect the fares could be higher
    there and flights there might be harder to find.</p>

    <h2>What is the cost for Buckit Week?</h2>
    <p>The week's activities are being provided for a very low
    registration fee of $75 per person. This includes meals and
    lodging in the hotel at 3 persons per room.  The rooms are larger
    than standard, and each room has two beds plus a pull out
    sofa. The true cost of the the week is more than this amount, but
    we want to encourage those whom the Lord may be leading to attend
    and who will be most likely to benefit from the week's
    activities. To this end we are looking to the Lord and operating
    in dependence on Him to supply the needs.</p>

    <h2>Who can attend Buckit Week?</h2>
    <p>We are seeking a wide range of ages. While the week could be seen as generally geared
    for 18-30+, it is also geared for some in the 15-17 age range who would benefit greatly and are certainly encouraged to come 
    with special permission. Please <%= link_to 'contact the registrar', :controller => 'welcome', :action => 'contact' %> for 
    specific guidance if you are in that range and wish to attend.</p>

    <h2>Why use &quot;University&quot; in the description of the week?</h2>
    <p>The reason is to accurately distinguish the week from other
    kinds of good week-long activities like camps and conferences.</p>

    <h2>Is Buckit Week just another week-long conference?</h2>
    <p>No. The teaching at Buckit Week is in a classroom setting, with
    tables, notebooks, resources, homework, and exams (not scary ones,
    though!)</p>

    <h2>Is Buckit Week a camp?</h2>
    <p>No. First, it is not held at a camp. Second, the goals are
    different than any &quot;camp&quot; we know about. </p>

    <h2>Will Buckit Week be boring?</h2>
    <p>HEY--We're calling it Buckit Week! Enough said!</p>


    <h2>Who is involved with Buckit week?</h2>

    preparations for Buckit Week 2007: Rockville Bible Fellowship
    (MD), Michael Flester, Keith Keyser, Joe-Paul and June Swinski,
    and Craig Shakarji. Craig will be directing the activities during
    the week.</p>
